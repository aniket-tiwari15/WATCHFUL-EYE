##  Machine Learning solution for Suspicious Actions Detection System Using Surveillance Video.
This project aims to develop a pre-incident warning system for detecting suspicious activity in crowded places,
such as shopping malls, airports, and public transit stations. The project aims to use machine learning (ML)
and deep learning (DL) algorithms, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN), to monitor human
gestures and unusual activities captured by surveillance cameras to predict and alert authorities
of potentially suspicious activity before it occurs. The goal is to create a highly accurate, precise, and
reliable system to enhance the pre-suspicious activity alert security system and avoid risky situations.
